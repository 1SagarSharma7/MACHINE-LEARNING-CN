Adding additional features (columns) in dataframe. (to draw complex boundaries and then applying Linear Regression only)

Printing confusion matrix (in classification problems).

And classification report.

### Cross Validation ###

Take out some part of total data for testing.

### Mathematical calculations for Logistic Regression ###

* Binary Classification
* Decision Boundary
* Cost entropy
* Sigmoid Function
* Derivation of cost function and gradient descent

### MultiClass Classification###
example of iris dataset

### Regularisation ###
